* createApolloServer is used to create and configure an Express GraphQL server

* routes are integrated into Meteor and you can navigate to your GraphQL
* endpoint/GraphiQL path just like any other page in your application; for
* instance: http://localhost:3000/graphiql
* createApolloServer(customOptions = {}, customConfig = {})
* see: http://dev.apollodata.com/core/meteor.html#createApolloServer
* See: https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration/blob/master/src/main-server.js

* customOptions is an object that can have any GraphQL Server options
* (http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-server/setup.html#graphqlOptions)
* used to enhance the GraphQL server run thanks to graphqlExpress.
*
* Defining a customOptions object extends or replaces fields of the default configuration provided by the package:
*
*   context: {}, ensure that a context object is defined for the resolvers.
*   formatError: a function used to format errors before returning them to clients.
*   debug: Meteor.isDevelopment, additional debug logging if execution errors occur in dev mode.

/*
* customConfig is an optional object that can be used to replace the configuration of how the Express server itself runs:
*
*   path: path of the GraphQL server. This is the endpoint where the queries & mutations are sent. Default: /graphql.
*   configServer: a function that is given to the express server for further configuration. You can for instance enable CORS with createApolloServer({}, {configServer: expressServer => expressServer.use(cors())})
*   graphiql: whether to enable GraphiQL. Default: true in development and false in production.
*   graphiqlPath: path for GraphiQL. Default: /graphiql (note the i).
*   graphiqlOptions: GraphiQL options Default: attempts to use Meteor.loginToken from localStorage to log you in.
*
* It will use the same port as your Meteor server. Donâ€™t put a route or static asset at the same path as the GraphQL route or the GraphiQL route if in use (again, defaults are /graphql and /graphiql respectively).
