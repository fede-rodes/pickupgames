/*
 * Apollo Client lets you attach GraphQL queries to your UI components to easily load data
 *
 * We use the `graphql` higher order component to send the graphql query to our server
 * See for more information: http://dev.apollodata.com/react/
 * The graphql() container is the recommended approach for fetching data or
 * making mutations. It is a React Higher Order Component, and interacts with
 * the wrapped component via props.
 */
/*
 * The config object is the second argument you pass into the graphql() function,
 * after your GraphQL document. The config is optional and allows you to add
 * some custom behavior to your higher order component.
 * See: http://dev.apollodata.com/react/api-graphql.html
 *
 * config.options:
 * is an object or a function that allows you to define the specific behavior
 * your component should use in handling your GraphQL data.
 * The specific options available for configuration depend on the operation you
 * pass as the first argument to graphql(). There are options specific to
 * queries and mutations.
 * You can define config.options as a plain object, or you can compute your
 * options from a function that takes the componentâ€™s props as an argument.
 *
 * config.props:
 * The config.props property allows you to define a map function that takes your
 * props including the props added by the graphql() function (props.data for
 * queries and props.mutate for mutations) and allows you to compute a new props
 * object that will be provided to the component that graphql() is wrapping.
 * The function you define behaves almost exactly like mapProps from Recompose
 * providing the same benefits without the need for another library.
 * config.props is most useful when you want to abstract away complex functions
 * calls into a simple prop that you can pass down to your component.
 * Another benefit of config.props is that it also allows you to decouple your
 * pure UI components from your GraphQL and Apollo concerns. You can write your
 * pure UI components in one file and then keep the logic required for them to
 * interact with the store in a completely different place in your project. You
 * can accomplish this by your pure UI components only asking for the props
 * needed to render and config.props can contain the logic to provide exactly
 * the props your pure component needs from the data provided by your GraphQL API.
 *
 * Other props: skip, name, ...
 *
 * import { compose } from 'react-apollo';
 * The following example uses the compose() function to use multiple graphql() enhancers at once.
 *  export default compose(
 *    graphql(gql`query MyQuery1 { ... }`, { skip: props => !props.useQuery1 }),
 *    graphql(gql`query MyQuery2 { ... }`, { skip: props => props.useQuery1 }),
 *  )(MyComponent);
 *
 *  function MyComponent({ data }) {
 *    // The data may be from `MyQuery1` or `MyQuery2` depending on the value
 *    // of the prop `useQuery1`.
 *    console.log(data);
 *  }
 *
 * export default compose(
 *  withApollo,
 *  graphql(`query { ... }`),
 *  graphql(`mutation { ... }`),
 *  connect(...),
 * )(MyComponent);
