### pickupgames.net, Meteor React Redux FlowRouter ES6 web app
Web app for easily organize sport activities and connect players. Current version of the app hosted here: https://pickupgamess.herokuapp.com
Previous version of the app (Meteor 1.2 + Blaze) can be found here: https://www.fulbacho.net

The aim of this project is to make a Progressive Web App(1,2) picking
some of the ideas / structure used in fulbacho.net. The stack used for this
project is as follows: Meteor, React, Redux, Flow / React router.
Additionally, I would like to keep the project as simple as possible and for this
reason I'll focus on mobile view only.
