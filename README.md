### fulbacho, Meteor-React-FlowRouter-ES6
Web app for easily organize sport activities and connect players. Previous
version of the app (Meteor 1.2 + Blaze) can be found here: https://www.fulbacho.net

The aim of this project is to make a Progressive Web App* picking
some of the ideas / structure used in fulbacho.net. The stack used for this
project is as follows: Meteor, React, Redux, Flow / React router.
Additionally, I would like to keep the project as simple as possible and for this
reason I'll focus on mobile views only.
